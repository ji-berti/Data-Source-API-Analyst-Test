This guide outlines common issues encountered when interacting with the GitHub REST API and provides concrete steps to resolve them. The file `api_extraction.log` generated by the Colab notebook keeps a record of all operations and detailed error messages from the API.

### Error: '401 Unauthorized'
The server returns a `401 Unauthorized` error.

#### Possible Causes:
1. The access token is missing, expired, or incorrect.
2. The Authorization header is not formatted correctly.

#### Solution:
1. Ensure you include the following header:
  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <your_personal_access_token>
  ```
2. Make sure the token has appropriate scopes (e.g., `public_repo` for public data).

### Error: '403 Forbidden / Rate Limit Exceeded'
You hit the API rate limit and are unable to get a response

#### Possible Causes:
- GitHub limits API calls per hour (30 unauthenticated, 5000 authenticated).

#### Solution:
1. **Make sure to authenticate and create a token.**
2. **Check response headers:**
  ```
  X-RateLimit-Limit
  X-RateLimit-Remaining
  X-RateLimit-Reset
  ```
3. **Implement wait logic or exponential backoff if the remaining limit is low.**

### Error: `404 Not Found`

GitHub uses a `404` response instead of `403 Forbidden` for unauthorized access to private resources to avoid revealing their existence.

#### Possible Causes:
1.  **Incorrect Resource Path:** A typo exists in the `owner`, `repo`, or `path` parameters provided to the function.
2.  **Authentication Failure:** The resource is private or requires specific permissions, and your request was not properly authenticated.

#### Solution:
1.  **Check the Log File:** Open `api_extraction.log`. The logged error will contain the exact URL that failed (e.g., `404 Client Error: Not Found for url: ...`).
2.  **Verify Parameters:** Double-check the `owner`, `repo`, and `path` variables in your notebook to ensure they are correct.
3.  **Check Authentication Credentials:** If the resource exists but you are getting a `404`, the issue is almost certainly authentication.
    * Navigate to the **Colab Secrets panel** (ðŸ”‘).
    * Ensure the secret named `GITHUB_TOKEN` exists and its value is the correct Personal Access Token (PAT).
    * Go to your **GitHub Developer Settings** and verify that your PAT:
        * Has not expired or been revoked.
        * Has the necessary **scopes** required for the endpoint (e.g., the `repo` scope is needed to access private repositories).

### Error: `403 Forbidden` or `429 Too Many Requests`

This error indicates you've hit a rate limit or have a permissions issue.

#### Possible Causes:
1.  **Primary Rate Limit Exceeded:** You have made more than the allowed number of requests per hour (5,000 for authenticated users).
2.  **Secondary Rate Limit Exceeded:** You have made requests too aggressively in a short period, triggering abuse-prevention mechanisms.
3.  **Insufficient Permissions:** Your token is valid but lacks the specific permissions required for the requested action (e.g., trying to write content with a read-only token).

#### Solution
1.  **Check the Log File:**
    * Look for the last `Rate Limit:` message before the error occurred. If it shows `0/5000`, you have exhausted your primary limit.
    * The detailed error message from the API, which we log, might explicitly mention a "secondary rate limit".
2.  **Respect API Headers:**
    * The documentation states that if the `x-ratelimit-remaining` header is `0`, you must wait until the time specified in the `x-ratelimit-reset` header (a UTC epoch timestamp) before making new requests.
    * If the response includes a `Retry-After` header, wait for that number of seconds.
3.  **Verify Permissions:**
    * If you are not hitting a rate limit, the `403` error means your token lacks permission. Go to your PAT settings on GitHub and ensure it has the required scopes for the operation you are attempting. The `X-Accepted-GitHub-Permissions` header in the response can also tell you what permissions are needed.

### Error: `422 Unprocessable Entity`

This error means your request was well-formed, but GitHub could not process it due to invalid data.

#### Possible Causes:
* A required parameter was omitted from the request.
* The data type of a parameter was incorrect (e.g., providing a string where an array is expected).

#### Solution:
1.  **Check the Log File:** The detailed error message we log is critical here. The response body from the API will contain an `errors` property with a specific `code` (e.g., `missing_field`, `invalid`) that tells you exactly what was wrong with your request.
2.  **Review API Documentation:** Refer to the official GitHub API documentation for the endpoint you are using. Verify that you are including all required parameters and that their data types are correct.

### Error: Timeout

This occurs if GitHub takes more than 10 seconds to process your request.

#### Possible Causes:
* The API is experiencing a partial outage or high load.
* Your request is too complex (e.g., searching for a very broad term, requesting a very large number of items per page).

#### Solution
1.  **Check GitHub's Status:** Visit [https://www.githubstatus.com](https://www.githubstatus.com) to see if there is an active incident affecting the REST API.
2.  **Simplify Your Request:** Try making your search query more specific or reducing the `per_page` count in your parameters.
3.  **Retry Later:** Wait a few minutes and run the script again.

### Error: Pagination Issues

You recieve only a subset of results.

#### Possible Causes:
- Github paginates responses for most endpoints, the output can seem truncated.

#### Solution:
- Use `?per_page=100&page=N` in your requests.
- Loop through pages until no results are returned.
